[00:02.97] Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
[00:06.09] I was in your sights, you got me alone
[00:09.18] You found me, you found me, you found me, e-e-e-e
[00:15.42] I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
[00:18.43] And when I fell hard, you took a step back
[00:21.68] Without me, without me, without me, e-e-e-e
[00:43.18] 
[00:28.68] And he's long gone when he's next to me
[00:35.20] And I realize the blame is on me
[00:51.20] 
[00:40.30] 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[00:44.96] So shame on me now
[00:47.13] Flew me to places I'd never been
[00:51.06] 'Til you put me down, oh
[00:53.12] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[00:57.35] So shame on me now
[00:59.55] Flew me to places I'd never been
[01:03.48] Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[01:06.47] Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
[01:12.06] Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
[01:28.56] 
[01:18.07] No apologies, he'll never see you cry
[01:20.86] Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
[01:23.92] You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning, i-i-i-ing
[01:30.21] Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
[01:33.35] A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
[01:36.44] And now I see, now I see, now I see, e-e-e-e
[01:58.44] 
[01:43.68] He was long gone when he met me
[01:50.05] And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
[02:08.55] 
[01:55.39] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[01:59.62] So shame on me now
[02:01.98] Flew me to places I'd never been
[02:05.83] 'Til you put me down, oh
[02:07.98] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[02:12.15] So shame on me now
[02:14.34] Flew me to places I'd never been
[02:18.47] Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[02:21.17] Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
[02:27.05] Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
[02:43.55] 
[02:32.87] And the saddest fear
[02:35.36] Comes creeping in
[02:38.45] That you never loved me
[02:41.06] Or her, or anyone, or anything
[02:45.12] Yeah!
[02:47.62] 
[02:46.99] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[02:51.03] So shame on me now
[02:53.35] Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
[02:57.14] 'Til you put me down, oh
[02:59.38] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[03:02.83] (Knew it right there) so shame on me now (knew it right there)
[03:05.82] Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh!)
[03:09.54] Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[03:12.50] Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
[03:18.48] Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
[03:34.98] 
[03:24.27] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[03:28.12] Trouble, trouble, trouble
[03:30.43] I knew you were trouble when you walked in
[03:34.12] Trouble, trouble, trouble
